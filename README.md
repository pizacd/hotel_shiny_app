Dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand). The data is originally from the article `Hotel Booking Demand Datasets`, written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019.

It contains hotel reservation data for two hotels in Portugal: a city hotel in Lisbon and a resort hotel in Algarve.

The objective was to create an R Shiny dashboard to summarize revenue by season, which parameters relate to customers more likely to cancel their reservation, and if there is an ideal time period to send out promotional/marketing material to increase new and returning guests.
